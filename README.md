# Supervised Learning with Scikit-Learn
This repo showcases my progress through DataCamp's "Supervised Learning with Scikit-Learn" course. Highlights:

- *Classification & Regression Models*: Developed models for predicting outcomes in both categorical (classification) and continuous (regression) scenarios.

- *Data Preparation*: Ensured data quality through techniques like feature scaling and handling missing values.

- *Model Selection & Evaluation*: Expertly chose models and evaluated performance for reliability.

- *Pipeline Efficiency*: Organized workflows for reproducible results.
